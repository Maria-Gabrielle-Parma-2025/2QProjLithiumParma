                <div class="about-text"><p>Our vision is to raise awareness of the different issues related to the environment and climate change, so that calls to make widespread solutions to it are heard and taken action on by the government by 2027. While there are many parts to this problem, each with its own solution, there are solutions that must be executed by the government due to both its complexity and its need to be widespread. </p></div>

                <div class="about-text"><p>We are a group of people who wish to spread awareness about climate change, its sub-issues, and its solutions. By spreading awareness in a website that is informative yet easy-to-digest, we can encourage more people to speak up, especially people with high influence such as celebrities and government officers.</p></div>
